System Log Event Block Detector (SLEBD)
Main program entrence: main.py
	Program execution command: python main.py {log_file_folder_path}
About log_file_folder:
	The log_file_folder must have multiple subfolders, their names should be 1, 2, ......
	Please download the example log file folder from path: https://github.com/zongzeliunt/SLEBD/tree/master/test_log_file
	We have included an example log_file_folder in this program. It was preprocessed from Mutrino system log. Each sub-folder contains 118 node files and each file contains all message on this node in a 2 day period. This example log file folder have 10 days of Mutrino system log messages.
	Such file preprocess operated is done by using Baler. We use Baler to split mixed original files by both time period and node name.
	All log files have a number in bracket at the front of each line, for example: [131]. This number is generated by Baler. However we are not using this Baler pattern name in our program.
	We use this example to show how our SLEBD program works.


About SLEBD:
	SLEBD have two main features:
	1) EBD learning
		SLEBD learn Event Block Database  from learning file set. EBD can be updated real time by analyzing new time period log file folder. 
		EBD store all processed single line patterns, which EB it belongs, occurring together other message patterns. The transition matrix generated from this time period log files and the whole transition matrix generated from all processed time period log folders. And EB patterns. 
		EBD is a set of files stored in folder sql_database. The sub-folder which have the biggest number is the latest EBD. We keep all processed EBD sub-folders because we want to see how every single line patterns' relationship changed with other patterns. 
		 
	2) EB list extraction
		SLEBD can extract EB lists from input files based on the latest learned EBD. It will first load the latest EBD and use it to map log files. Then it generate single pattern file and EB list for each log file. EB list report have the same sub-folder name as original log files have. 
		Please noticed: SLEBD will only load the latest EBD. For example, our example log file have 5 folders, the largest number is 4. So the EBD learned from the example log file also have 5 sub-folders. When doing EB list extraction, SLEBD only load EBD in path: "sql_database/4".
		EB list extraction operation will also report extraction error and generate multi line block example. They will be dumped into file "extract_error_report.txt" and "example_report.txt".

	This program will also summary how many time each single line message or EB pattern occurred. They will be dumped into file "single_line_report.txt" and "total_event_report.txt"
